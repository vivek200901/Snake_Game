I have created a classic Snake game using Java (Swing and AWT). I build this game step by step from scratch. In this game I have learn how to design the game board , handle user input, implement snake movement, and incorporate collision detection.
Basically the technology that are used in this game are Core java (swing,AWT,Graphics,OOPS,Abstract Classes,Interface) and the Intellij IDE.
